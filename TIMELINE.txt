CrescendAI Research & Product Timeline
======================================

Current State (Jan 2025)
------------------------
- Paper submitted: Audio foundation models for piano evaluation
- MuQ model: R² = 0.537 on PercePiano (55% over symbolic baseline)
- Validated: Cross-soundfont, PSyllabus difficulty, MAESTRO zero-shot
- Key limitation: Model captures piece characteristics more than performer quality


Architecture Vision
-------------------
The full system requires four components working together:

1. Audio-rendered MIDI score: Structural reference (where in the piece, what should happen)
   - Keeps everything in audio space (no lossy audio->MIDI transcription)
   - MIDI score rendered via Pianoteq = 100% accurate reference
   - Enables structural awareness without symbolic conversion errors

2. Contrastive embeddings: "What is good playing" (Phase 1)
   - Learned similarity space where quality clusters together
   - Disentangles piece characteristics from performer quality

3. Temporal localization: "Where in the performance" (Phase 3)
   - Points to specific moments, not just overall scores
   - Multi-scale: segment, phrase, passage level

4. Pedagogical interpretive layer: "What to say about it" (Phase 4)
   - Maps embedding distances to actionable feedback
   - Captures teacher prioritization and vocabulary


Phase 1: Contrastive Learning for Performer Quality
----------------------------------------------------------------
SOLVES: Model currently captures piece characteristics more than performer quality.
Without this, we can't distinguish "hard piece played adequately" from "easy piece 
played poorly."

Goal: Disentangle piece difficulty from performer quality

- Contrastive learning on ASAP/MAESTRO multi-performer data
- Train model to rank performances of the same piece
- Dimension-specific ranking (which has better timing? dynamics?)
- Publishable paper: "Disentangling Piece and Performer in Piano Evaluation"

Success metric: Pairwise ranking accuracy on held-out pieces

Key insight: Same-piece comparisons force the model to attend to performer 
differences since piece characteristics are held constant.


Phase 2: Audio-Space Score Alignment
-------------------------------------------------
SOLVES: Need structural reference for "where are we in the piece" without 
lossy audio->MIDI transcription. Foundation for temporal localization.

Goal: Align student performance to rendered MIDI score, entirely in audio space

Approach:
- Render MIDI score to audio via Pianoteq (100% accurate reference)
- Develop audio-to-audio alignment between student performance and reference
- Keeps everything in audio space - avoids transcription errors
- Handles student mistakes (wrong notes, skipped sections) gracefully

Technical considerations:
- What comparison function works in MuQ embedding space?
- How to handle tempo variation, rubato?
- Chunk size for alignment (frame-level vs segment-level)?

Key insight: Teachers think in musical landmarks ("the transition into the 
development") not measure numbers. Alignment enables structural awareness;
student-facing localization can still be timestamp-based.

Success metric: Accurate alignment on MAESTRO (where ground truth exists)


Phase 3: Grounding in Pedagogy
-------------------------------------------
SOLVES: Contrastive model can detect "this is far from good playing" but can't 
explain WHY or what to DO about it. Embedding distance is not actionable feedback.

Goal: Build the interpretive layer that maps model representations to pedagogical action

Core question: When a teacher evaluates a student, what's actually in their head 
as the reference? How do we capture tacit expert knowledge in ML-usable form?

THREE OPTIONS TO EXPLORE:

Option A: Dimension Labels
- "When a teacher stops and says X, that maps to feedback category Y"
- Build taxonomy of actionable feedback types
- Model learns to predict which category applies to a given segment
- Output: Classification over feedback dimensions
- Pro: Clean ML formulation
- Con: May impose artificial structure on fluid teaching

Option B: Priority Signal  
- Not what's wrong, but what's WORTH MENTIONING
- Teacher heard ten things, chose to stop for one
- Learning the filtering/attention function
- Output: Ranking or selection over possible feedback
- Pro: Matches how teachers actually work (selective, not exhaustive)
- Con: Harder to train - need negative examples of "noticed but didn't mention"

Option C: Transformation Directions
- "This is what bad-to-good looks like for this specific issue"
- Not just distance in embedding space, but DIRECTION
- Vector from "rushed phrasing" toward "patient phrasing"
- Output: Directional vectors in embedding space with semantic labels
- Pro: Could enable generative feedback ("try it more like this")
- Con: Requires paired examples of same passage with different qualities

DATA SOURCE: Masterclass recordings (YouTube, Tonebase, conservatory archives)
- Stopping points = implicit "this matters enough to halt momentum"
- Verbal feedback = dimension vocabulary grounded in real teaching
- Sequence of feedback = prioritization signal
- Student level + repertoire = context

Advantages over paid annotation:
- Teachers revealing actual decision-making, not performing for researcher
- Ecological validity - real teaching moments
- Massive scale available (thousands of hours on YouTube)

Challenges:
- Transcription and timestamping is labor-intensive
- Nonverbal references ("that bit there") hard to capture
- Selection bias: masterclass students are already good
- May not transfer to intermediate students with basic errors

Minimum viable data collection:
- TBD: What's the smallest dataset that tests whether this approach works?

Deliverable: One of the three options above, validated against teacher judgments


Phase 4: Temporal Localization
--------------------------------------------------
SOLVES: Overall segment scores aren't useful for practice. Need to point to 
specific moments. "Measures 12-16" or "the chromatic run before the recap."

Goal: Localize feedback to specific moments in the performance

Integration challenge: Combines contrastive embeddings (Phase 1) with score 
alignment (Phase 2) to localize pedagogical feedback (Phase 3).

Technical approaches:
- Frame-level prediction using aligned audio pairs
- Multi-scale predictions (segment, phrase, passage)
- Attention-based localization as interpretability tool
- Leverage Phase 2 alignment for structural grounding

Open question: Can attention weights from MuQ provide interpretable localization 
without explicit frame-level supervision?

Success metric: Teachers validate localized feedback as meaningful


Phase 5: Real Audio & Student Data
-----------------------------------------------
SOLVES: All training on synthetic Pianoteq audio. Real recordings have room 
acoustics, mic variance, noise, instrument differences.

Goal: Bridge synthetic-to-real gap, collect student performances

- Domain adaptation: room acoustics, mic variance, noise augmentation
- Partner with 1-2 music schools for data collection
- Collect student recordings with teacher annotations
- Privacy/consent framework
- Validate model on real student data

Critical question: Does the masterclass feedback (to advanced students) transfer 
to intermediate students with basic errors? This phase tests that assumption.

Deliverable: Dataset of student performances with teacher feedback


Phase 6: Product MVP
---------------------------------
Goal: Working tutor for serious piano students

Core features:
- Upload recording, get feedback
- Comparison to audio-rendered score reference
- Temporal localization with musical landmarks
- Prioritized feedback (not exhaustive list)
- Progress tracking over time

Technical requirements:
- Inference latency < 5 seconds per segment
- Works with phone recordings
- Audio-space score alignment


Phase 7: Real-Time Interaction
--------------------------------------
COMPLEXITY: Very High (unsolved research + product/UX challenges)
DEPENDENCIES: Everything else plus new research
Goal: Live feedback during practice - AI as practice companion

Vision: Seamless open recording session with AI filling gaps between playing 
with guidance. Like a masterclass where AI can wait for natural pauses and 
guide student through a lesson.

NOT: Eager AI that interrupts constantly or lists everything wrong
IS: Selective, prioritized, well-timed guidance that earns trust

Key challenges:
- Interruption timing (wrong moment breaks flow, damages confidence)
- Building trust (teacher earns right to interrupt through relationship)
- Limited context (AI has seconds/minutes of audio, not years of student history)
- "When to speak" is harder than "what to say"

This phase depends on:
- Model efficiency improvements for streaming
- Advances in real-time audio ML
- User research on practice workflows
- Novel research on conversational timing in educational contexts


Open Research Questions
-----------------------
From paper:
- How much does annotation noise limit performance ceiling?
- Can contrastive learning work with noisy proxy labels?
- What temporal resolution is useful for feedback?
- How to handle interpretation differences (valid variation vs error)?
- Generalization to other instruments?

From Phase 3 discussion:
- Is teacher mental reference even consistent across student levels?
- Does masterclass feedback (to advanced students) transfer to intermediate students?
- What's the minimum viable masterclass dataset to test the approach?
- Which of the three options (dimensions, priority, directions) is most tractable?

From score alignment discussion:
- Can audio-to-audio comparison replace symbolic alignment entirely?
- What comparison function works in MuQ embedding space?
- How to handle student mistakes (wrong notes, skipped sections) in alignment?
