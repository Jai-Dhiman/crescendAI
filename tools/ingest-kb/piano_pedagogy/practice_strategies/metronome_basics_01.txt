A metronome is a tool to establish an objective pulse while you refine timing. Use it to detect rushing/dragging and to stabilize subdivisions.

Practice steps:
- Start with a comfortable tempo where passages feel effortless.
- Count aloud or internally subdivide (e.g., "1 e & a") for sixteenth-note figures.
- Alternate on-beat clicks and off-beat clicks to test internalization.
- Reduce click density (e.g., clicks on beats 1 and 3, then only on 1) to strengthen internal pulse.
- Record short takes and listen for alignment with clicks.
