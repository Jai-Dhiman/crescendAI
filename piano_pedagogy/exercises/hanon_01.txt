Hanon exercise No. 1 emphasizes even finger action and relaxed hand posture. Begin slowly with a metronome, aiming for consistent tone across all fingers.

Guidelines:
- Keep wrists neutral and relaxed; avoid vertical wrist motion.
- Use minimal finger lift; prioritize evenness over speed.
- Practice hands separate first, then together.
- Gradually increase tempo only when tone and timing are stable.
- Track 5-minute blocks per hand before combining.
