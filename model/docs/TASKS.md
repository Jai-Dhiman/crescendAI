**Current Phase**: Performance optimization through systematic improvements

### ðŸ“Š Current Performance Analysis (Revised Understanding)
- **AST Model**: 0.5285 overall correlation (90% of Random Forest)
- **Random Forest**: 0.5869 correlation (leverages domain knowledge + ensemble)
- **Gap to Close**: +0.0584 correlation (achievable with architecture + features)
- **Realistic Target**: 0.60-0.65 correlation (strong result for dataset size)
- **Publication Quality**: Any improvement over RF is significant given data constraints

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Random Forest is Winning (Critical Insights)
1. **Massive Overfitting**: 86M parameters on 832 samples = 103k samples per parameter (catastrophic)
2. **Domain Knowledge Gap**: RF uses 50+ hand-crafted musical features, AST learns from raw spectrograms
3. **Ensemble Advantage**: RF is inherently an ensemble (100+ trees), AST is single model
4. **Data Efficiency**: Tree-based methods excel with limited data, transformers need 10k+ samples
5. **Feature Engineering**: RF directly accesses MFCCs, spectral, harmonic features that encode musical knowledge

## Current Sprint: Performance Optimization (Weeks 1-4)

*Updated with performance analysis - 2025-01-09*

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRIORITY - Week 1: Architecture-First + Hybrid Features (Expected +0.08-0.12 correlation)

- [ ] **Ultra-Small Architecture Testing** (Priority #1)
  - Test drastically smaller models: 5M, 10M, 15M, 20M parameters (NOT 30M+)
  - Compare 3, 4, 6 layers (NOT 8-12) with embedding dims 256, 384, 512
  - **Critical insight**: 832 samples cannot support 86M parameters (100:1 ratio)
  - **Expected Result**: +0.05-0.08 correlation from reduced overfitting

- [ ] **Immediate Hybrid Feature Integration** (Priority #2)
  - Extract MFCC, spectral, harmonic features that Random Forest uses

  - **Expected Result**: +0.03-0.06 correlation from feature engineering

- [ ] **Smart Data Augmentation** (Priority #3)
  - Conservative augmentation: time-stretch (0.9-1.1x), pitch-shift (Â±1 semitone)
  - SpecAugment with piano-specific parameters
  - Target: 3x dataset (quality over quantity)
  - **Expected Result**: +0.02-0.04 correlation support for smaller model
