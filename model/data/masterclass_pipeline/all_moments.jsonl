Just as an exercise for me.\n[1491.2s] So again, I want to suggest to you,\n[1493.1s] in order to really feel the intervals,\n[1495.5s] in order to feel the melody,\n[1497.2s] and not waste the melody for the tempo,\n[1501.4s] so just to feel the melody well,\n[1503.9s] to play it in thirds.\n[1505.7s] And then forget about the thirds.\n[1507.7s] So let's play it like this.\n[1514.6s] In thirds like this.\n[1516.9s] And everything it does,\n[1519.1s] it neutralizes the feeling of the previous metronome,\n[1523.9s] and then you can go back to the previous metronome,\n[1526.4s] and play it right, as Chopin wrote.\n[1528.9s] But when you play it in thirds,\n[1530.8s] suddenly you look at it from a different angle,\n[1535.2s] from a different point of view,\n[1536.9s] and you feel the intervals more correctly.\n[1539.6s] So let's see it in thirds,\n[1541.2s] starting with the E flat.\n[1542.4s] E flat, E flat, E flat, E flat, E flat...\n[1556.3s] Great.\n[1558.2s] I felt different intervals and different melodies.\n[1562.2s] I want to say this in the clearest way,\n[1565.6s] I don't expect you to play like this,\n[1568.4s] it's just a preparation exercise,\n[1569.8s] a preparatory exercise,\n[1571.9s] it's not to play like this,\n[1573.7s] it's to look at it differently,\n[1576.1s] and mainly to digest what we feel all the time,\n[1580.6s] and to feel this melody more,\n[1582.9s] its plasticity,\n[1584.1s] because it's a very, very nice melody.\n[1586.0s] Now we've come to the Jewish moment,\n[1588.7s] the Jewish recitative,\n[1592.4s] which is a little more intuitive.\n[1608.1s] Great.\n[1609.2s] You did all the stops very well,\n[1611.4s] how you entered the melody so beautifully,\n[1614.3s] and now, at this moment, the Corre Petito comes in,\n[1617.9s] which until now was in silence,\n[1619.1s] and he plays the chord,\n[1621.3s] and he helps our singer...\n[1621.0s] And he helps our singer.","feedback_summary":"The teacher suggests playing in groups of three to better feel the melody and intervals, recommending this method as an exercise rather than a performance practice.","musical_dimension":"phrasing","secondary_dimensions":["interpretation","timing"],"severity":"suggestion","feedback_type":"suggestion","piece":"Chopin Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23","composer":"Chopin","passage_description":null,"student_level":null,"stop_order":9,"total_stops":16,"time_spent_seconds":55.0,"demonstrated":true,"extracted_at":"2026-02-15T05:07:33.315052+00:00","extraction_model":"gpt-4o","confidence":0.7}

Yeah, try.\n[1187.8s] Put the whole power down into the hand.\n[1192.4s] So, relax, you know.\n[1198.9s] Relax, and from here, a lot of energy coming from the back, just...\n[1206.5s] Too much coming from here.\n[1209.0s] Try to relax and...\n[1211.5s] Uh-huh.\n[1223.2s] OK, OK.\n[1224.3s] We don't need more sound here, but big concert hall,\n[1227.9s] you may be confronted with the problem of just, you know, giving more,\n[1231.7s] and then you know where to take it from.\n[1233.7s] Because when you put it from here,\n[1237.0s] it's a big danger to get in trouble.\n[1240.7s] No, wonderful playing, I really have great respect for it,\n[1244.2s] and I wish you that you play concerts as soon as possible,\n[1247.3s] so you can try out these things, you can improve the things,\n[1250.3s] you can get the contact with the audience, and, you know...\n[1254.2s] Do you have something else you wanted to play?\n[1256.9s] Not now.\n[1258.0s] Only this piece? Oh, this is so pity.\n[1261.4s] Thank you very much.\n[1262.8s] I will not say any word. Thank you.\n[1265.2s] Thank you.\n[1269.2s] How did you get so much praise for your masterclass?\n[1272.3s] You were supposed to teach, and he almost did, right?\n[1275.0s] You become completely flabbergasted.\n[1277.5s] You think, this can't be true.\n[1279.5s] Isn't that great?\n[1280.9s] It's incredible. You become very happy.\n[1283.6s] It's great to get some recognition.\n[1285.9s] I can't ask you what you got out of it, except that you were praised,\n[1289.5s] but he didn't teach you anything, did he?\n[1292.1s] He talked about a few technical things I can think of in general,\n[1296.4s] but that's something you have to work with in the long run.\n[1298.8s] You just have to look at a few things, and then you can go home and think about it.","feedback_summary":"The teacher demonstrates how to relax and transfer energy efficiently for improved sound production.","musical_dimension":"technique","secondary_dimensions":[],"severity":"moderate","feedback_type":"demonstration","piece":"Chopin Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23","composer":"Chopin","passage_description":null,"student_level":null,"stop_order":7,"total_stops":10,"time_spent_seconds":30.0,"demonstrated":true,"extracted_at":"2026-02-15T04:56:32.069831+00:00","extraction_model":"gpt-4o","confidence":0.7}

Now, just a couple of general things to improve,\n[475.1s] I hope improve and make more effective, just you don't have to play so loud in this piece,\n[482.0s] believe it or not, especially on a modern piano, you get so much, you get so much resonance,\n[487.9s] there are times when you can actually take it easier and as I was telling one of your colleagues,\n[491.4s] you have to scale the dynamics because, for example, I heard many times the great Spanish pianist\n[497.8s] Alicia de la Rocha who was about that tall and her, once we put ourselves together, because she\n[507.0s] always called me her giant and once we compared not only hand sizes but we noticed that\n[513.2s] with our middle fingers, the longest ones, that was her shoulder and that was her elbow there\n[520.0s] and yet she had a big sound, she didn't make as much noise as I do but she had a powerful sound\n[525.3s] because it was always balanced, that's another thing like I was saying in the Brahms, you know,\n[529.2s] if you play, as I said, if you play the right hand too loud and the left hand too soft,\n[534.9s] oh help, you know, so you get your real strength from that but also balance in chords,\n[542.9s] it's horrible but if you get them all, and you do, so I'm not criticizing you, you have it,\n[550.9s] but it's also a question of scaling, of scaling, so I was just thinking in the last page where\n[558.1s] Chopin asked the impossible because, you know, he always writes the most difficult\n[563.2s] music just when you're tired and your hand already hurts,\n[566.8s] so that's why I'm thinking about hopefully places where\n[540.0s] chords. It's horrible, but if you get them all, and you do, so I'm not criticizing you,\n[549.3s] you have it. But it's also a question of scaling.

Just thinking in terms of the drama\n[622.7s] of the things. So actually practice saving. In other words, not, as I say, saving, as\n[629.1s] I said earlier, not because you want to be boring and just safe. You can say, you can\n[635.2s] have a lot of excitement softer too. And when you hear things, these modern pianos have\n[639.8s] so much resonance. For example, this crescendo, you like everybody and me too, got too loud\n[645.1s] too soon. Because once again, that's a rather easier place. Wow, look at me. Boy, can I\n[653.2s] play loud and fast. Well, it could be quite electrifying and just make sure the crescendo\n[661.0s] goes all the way to there and that's only one forte. So just, this is just practical\n[664.7s] advice because it'll still sound pretty exciting, I promise you. I want to talk about the left\n[670.0s] hand in a minute and these stupid jumps. Dramatically, when the piece comes to a pause,\n[680.0s] more or less in the middle, and you took time, which makes sense. I'm just wondering. I don't\n[685.5s] know if you should. My inclination was that it sounds like, oh, the storm is down and\n[692.1s] now we know it's going to come back. But maybe. What? What? Rather than. That sounded\n[704.4s] a little bit lyric and friendly to me, but your intention was good. So once again, just\n[709.8s] think about it. But it should be. Oh no, and here it comes. And also, this crescendo happened\n[719.7s] too soon too, I'm sorry to say. Because it's an easy one too. You've just had, my goodness,\n[726.1s] you've had two whole beats of rest, which you don't get much in this piece. And then\n[731.3s] this is easy too. Here I go. Boy, am I powerful. But I would just. I mean, I can't play this\n[747.9s] piece at the moment, but it's just for that. Also, I would suggest some more varying the\n[755.0s] texture so that it's not always lots and lots of pedal. Something drier. I mean, this was\n[759.7s] wonderful.
